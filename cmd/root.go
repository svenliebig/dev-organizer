by providing a link between the tool you use the most (the cli) and the applications
that you have to use (like CI, CD, Dev/QA Stages, etc).

The goal is, to get less disrupted in your workflow and more time for important 
things, rather than waiting for lists of ci plans to fetch or waiting for bloated
web applications (*cough cough* jira *cough*) to execute a base functionality.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
